Ever-Winter-Knights-Delphi-Game
===============================

Ever Winter Knights game coded in Turbo Delphi (2010)

I programed this little game during school for my final year project. The game was regrettably built and compiled using Turbo Delphi and as such is nowhere near as good as it could have been.

However, I the project still received an excellent mark and as such I hope that by providing the source code it will help other students (primarily in South Africa) who are studying programming.

I would strongly recommend any student to try get a hold of Delphi 2010 or XE as it facilities better support than previous versions. Such as True-Transparency .png.


Instructions Overview
=============

1. The source code is provided and can be opened and re-compiled in: Turbo Delphi | Delphi 2010 | Delphi XE.
2. You can run the game from the .exe
3. An entire documentation PDF is provided explaining the systems and methods I used to build the game as well as commented source code.

* Game saves are bugged, you can't load a save. I have no idea why as I have not touched the code in over 4 years however, the saves worked fine in 2010 so there could be an error due to the year changing.
